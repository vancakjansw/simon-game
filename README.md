### Description
Simon's Game is a game developed in react-native. I created this for fun. Feel free to use any part of code. ;-)

### Technologies used
* react-native
* redux -> data layer
* redux-logger -> redux middleware for displaying changes in state in browser console  
* redux-thunk -> another redux middleware which allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action
* jest -> as a testing framework
* react-native-router-flux -> simple router with a great API

### A cube component
The most interesting part is a Cube component. This component contains core game code.

#### Methods I used:
* callback
* promise
* recursive function calling
* react-native Animation API

#### See short demo
